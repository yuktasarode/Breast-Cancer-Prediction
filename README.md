# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

> Developed a breast cancer prediction model to enable early detection of breast cancer
> Cleaned the data by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values.
> Utilized Matplotlib for EDA, including box plots, line plots, pie charts, and histograms, to understand feature distributions and identify outliers and Conducted feature selection using correlation analysis techniques 
> Implemented classification models such as DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, and KNeighborsClassifier.
> Utilized techniques like RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
> Achieved a 79% accuracy score using the Random Forest Classifier, demonstrating its potential for accurate breast cancer detection as the best-performing model.
